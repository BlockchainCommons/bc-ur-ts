# Blockchain Commons Uniform Resources (UR)

### _by Leonardo Custodio_

**`bc-ur-ts`** encodes binary data as URIs and animated QR sequences using the Uniform Resources specification, including fountain-coded multi-part transmission.

[Uniform Resources (URs)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) are URI-encoded [CBOR](https://cbor.io) structures developed by [Blockchain Commons](https://blockchaincommons.com). This package is intended primarily for use in higher-level Blockchain Commons projects like Gordian Envelope.

It is a requirement of the UR specification that the CBOR encoded as URs conform to Gordian dCBOR, which is a deterministic profile of CBOR specified in [this IETF Internet Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/).

## Installation Instructions

[@blockchaincommons/uniform-resources](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blockchaincommons/uniform-resources) is published to npm. Install it with your package manager of choice:

```sh
npm install @blockchaincommons/uniform-resources
# or
pnpm add @blockchaincommons/uniform-resources
# or
yarn add @blockchaincommons/uniform-resources
# or
bun add @blockchaincommons/uniform-resources
```

**Requirements:** TypeScript >= 5.7 is required to consume the published types. Node >= 22.12 is required.

## Usage Instructions

```typescript
import { UR, URError, MultipartEncoder, MultipartDecoder } from "@blockchaincommons/uniform-resources";
import { encodeBytewords } from "@blockchaincommons/uniform-resources/bytewords";
import { cbor } from "@blockchaincommons/dcbor";

// Single-part.
const ur = UR.from("test", cbor([1, 2, 3]));
ur.toString(); // "ur:test/lsadaoaxjygonesw"
ur.toQRString(); // "UR:TEST/LSADAOAXJYGONESW"
UR.parse("ur:test/lsadaoaxjygonesw").equals(ur); // true

// Multipart (animated QR): an infinite fountain of parts, decoded in any order.
const encoder = new MultipartEncoder(ur, 10);
const decoder = new MultipartDecoder();
for (const part of encoder) {
  decoder.add(part);
  if (decoder.done) break;
}
decoder.result?.equals(ur); // true

// Bytewords.
encodeBytewords(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), "standard"); // "acid also apex aqua arch fuel bald nail work"

try {
  UR.parse("ur:test/lsadaoaxjygonese");
} catch (e) {
  if (URError.isURError(e)) console.log(e.code); // "Bytewords"
}
```

## Status - Beta

`bc-ur-ts` is currently under active development and in beta testing. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing. See [Blockchain Commons' Development Phases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/blob/master/release-path.md).

### Version History

- **1.0.0-beta.1 (September 9, 2026)** - Initial beta release, extracted from the [`paritytech/bcts`](https://github.com/paritytech/bcts) monorepo and redesigned as an idiomatic TypeScript library over canonical dcbor ([MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md)). Every UR, bytewords and multipart string is unchanged and cross-validated against `bc-ur 0.19.2`.

### Roadmap

- Continued testing and auditing on the path from beta to a stable **1.0.0** release.
- Continued parity with the Rust reference implementation as it evolves (see [`RUST_DIVERGENCES.md`](./RUST_DIVERGENCES.md)).

### Dependencies

`@blockchaincommons/uniform-resources` depends on `@blockchaincommons/crypto`, `@blockchaincommons/dcbor` at runtime.

To build and work on this library, you'll need the following tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22.12 - JavaScript runtime.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - used in CI to install dependencies and run scripts (any Node-compatible package manager also works).
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) >= 5.7 - language and type checker.

### Derived from ...

This `bc-ur-ts` project is either derived from or was inspired by:

- [BlockchainCommons/bc-ur-rust](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur-rust) - The reference Rust implementation, by [Wolf McNally](https://github.com/wolfmcnally).
- [paritytech/bcts](https://github.com/paritytech/bcts) - A TypeScript port covering many Blockchain Commons' implementations, by [Parity Technologies](https://github.com/paritytech).
